# Minimalist Todo App

This is a minimalist todo app built using JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. The app allows you to create projects and within the projects, you can add tasks. The app includes authentication using Express, JWT, and cookies. The goal of this project was to create a functional full-stack application, but there are many options for improvement.

The React components used in this app were modified from a template from Creative Tim, for which we have a professional license.
